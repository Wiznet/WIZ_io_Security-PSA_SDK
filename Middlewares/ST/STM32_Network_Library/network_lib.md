# Purpose

The <mark>STM32 Network Library</mark> is a middleware providing network services on STM32 devices.
It provides a socket API (BSD like style) with support of secure or non secure connection and an API
to control the lifecycle of the network adapters.

Three classes of network adapters are supported
WIFI, Ethernet and Cellular. Different WIFI modules are supported from third party vendors.
